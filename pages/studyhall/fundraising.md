# About _Study Hall_ {% #studyhall %}

Emily Hansel, here, to announce that I’m choreographing, directing, and producing a new show and to ask for donations to support the artists involved in the creative process.

The new, evening-length work that I’m creating is called _Study Hall_ and will premiere May 16-18 at the Impact Center for Art & Dance in San Francisco. I’ve hired a truly dope team of artistic collaborators for this project including my creative, thoughtful cousin Sophia Cotraccia to compose the musical score, and my distinguished, inventive fellow USF grad Thomas Bowersox to oversee lighting and scenic design.

_Study Hall_ will be performed by four dancers (Rebecca Fitton, gizeh muñiz vengel, Jocelyn Reyes, and Erin Yen) who are absolute powerhouses in terms of their strength as performers as well as their choreographic ingenuity. All four (plus myself) identify as both a) choreographers who hire dancers and b) dancers who are hired by other choreographers. I’ve carefully curated this cast due to their artistic excellence as well as their fierce commitment to forging new models for equity in our field.

_Study Hall_ is oriented around the goal of breaking toxic patterns in our industry and embracing new ways of working. The process and performances will propose and model a new reality that centers equity, health, and sustainability. Over the last couple months, I’ve facilitated a series of [Community Study Halls](/community-study-halls) that are designed to bring Bay Area dancers and choreographers/directors together in discussion about cultivating healthy, equitable workplaces in our contemporary dance field. These public conversations have been on topics such as:

- Ownership and credit in collaborative processes
- Building budgets that prioritize dancer pay
- How can we hold decision-makers accountable?

The four _Study Hall_ dancers participated in these public conversations, whose content will both guide our workplace culture and function as source material for movement generation in the studio. We began rehearsals in January and will collaboratively craft _Study Hall_ over the course of five months. The final performances will be humorous and entertaining but also serious and thought-provoking, with the goal of inspiring cultural shift both within the dance ecosystem and beyond.

## Why now?

The experimental, justice-driven work behind _Study Hall_ feels urgent. Over the last year, I’ve found myself in lengthy brainstorming conversations with numerous colleagues. It’s clear to me that choreographers and dancers across my community are eager for conversation, experimentation, and concrete action that will push the field forward. We need new practices that can be feasibly implemented to counter oppressive defaults that are often built in to our workplaces. My four dancer collaborators and I are intent on modeling new workplace practices that we can all learn from and/or bring forth into future projects that we lead or participate in. Because the four cast members are leaders/employers/choreographers/directors in their own right, I envision _Study Hall_ having vital consequences for not only us as individuals, but for our Bay Area dance ecosystem at large.

## Fundraising needs

↳ I received a generous $20k grant from the San Francisco Arts Commission for _Study Hall_, which is extremely helpful and also just a huge honor to receive. Woohoo!

↳ BUT. This project is far from fully funded, and in order to make it happen, I need to raise an additional **$12,000**. I invite you to send a donation of whatever amount feels possible or meaningful to you.

To give you some context, I’ve listed out some amounts and their impacts below:

- $37 covers one dancer in one hour of rehearsal (wages + workers comp + payroll taxes)
- $111 covers hiring one dancer for a full 3-hour rehearsal
- $444 covers one 3-hour rehearsal with all four dancers
- $772 covers my entire general liability insurance policy
- $1,600 covers hiring my entire workers comp policy
- $4,250 covers my performance venue rental
