_Study Hall_, a new, full-length work choreographed and directed by Emily Hansel, is inspired by a series of [community workshops](/community-study-halls) designed to bring Bay Area dancers and choreographers/directors together in discussion about cultivating healthy, equitable workplaces in our contemporary dance field. _Study Hall’s_ four cast members participated in these conversations alongside members of the public and brought their takeaways into the studio for the development of _Study Hall_. All four of these dancers, Rebecca Fitton, gizeh muñiz vengel, Jocelyn Reyes, and Erin Yen, are self-producing choreographers in their own right and share an interest in forging new models for safety, equity, and sustainability in our field. Theirs and Emily’s shared experiences and common interests allowed for the development of a unique workplace culture grounded in accountability and experimentation.

In its final form, _Study Hall_ can accurately be described as both carefully crafted and highly unplanned. Treading the line between set choreography and improvisational score, _Study Hall_ exemplifies both the world building and dismantling that the artists crave. _Study Hall_ illustrates the relationships formed during the highly collaborative creative process—one that was full of conversation, movement, writing, drawing, laughing, sighing, and bonding over mutual experiences of leadership roles, administrative work, performance practice, and activism. The generous and committed dancing by this powerhouse quartet is complemented by original music from Sophia Cotraccia and lighting design by Thomas Bowersox.

_Study Hall_ is supported in part by the San Francisco Arts Commision and by Steppin’ Out Dance Studio.
