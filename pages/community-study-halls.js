            Community Study Halls for dancers and choreographers
          </h1>

          <p>
            I recently got funding from the SF Arts Commission (woohoo!) to host
            this series of six Community Study Halls that will bring dancers and
            choreographers/directors together in discussion about cultivating
            healthy, equitable, and ethical workplaces in our contemporary dance
            field. The series will also function as source material for the
            creative development of a new choreographic work that I’m creating
            with dancer-collaborators Rebecca Fitton, Audrey Johnson, Jocelyn
            Reyes, and Erin Yen, which will premiere May 16-18, 2024.
          </p>

          <p>
            My goal is for the Study Halls to be a place where people who hire
            dancers and people who are hired as dancers (or maybe you're both,
            like me!) can speak about the equitable hiring practices and working
            conditions they desire and how to make them a reality. We'll do some
            dreaming and will also focus on the logistics of implementation.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'd love to have you join us if you feel like sharing, venting,
            brainstorming, witnessing, or otherwise participating in
            conversations about the topics listed below. Come to all six or drop
            in to the ones that you’re most interested in. All are welcome, and
            RSVP is requested for each individual session you plan to attend.
          </p>

          <p>
            If anything about this project prompts questions, feedback, or
            ideas, I invite you to{" "}
            <a href="mailto:emily@emilyhansel.me">email me</a> so we can connect
            and discuss further.
